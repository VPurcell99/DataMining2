I modified professor Breitzman's KFolds Code on Breast Cancer tumor classification and had it analyze potable drinking water data.

Data Found at:
https://www.kaggle.com/adityakadiwal/water-potability

Python Code:    	HW1_kfolds.py
Jupyter:        	HW1_KFolds_jupyternb.ipynb
Jupyter HTML:   	HW1_JupyterOutput.HTML
Data:           	water_potability.csv
ChallengeQuestion:	HW1-ChallengeQuestion.pdf

I Used the MLP NN in sklearn and used 5 Fold Analysis.
